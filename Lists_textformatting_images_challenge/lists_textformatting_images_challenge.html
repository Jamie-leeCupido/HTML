    <h1>Linguine Vongole</h1>

    <p>My favorite dish <strong><em>Linguine Vongole</em></strong> is simple and effective. All you would basically need is <strong><em> linguine and clams</em></strong>. Quick and easy boil the pasta and cook clams seperately and some spices and viola</p>

  <h2><p><em><strong>Directions</em></strong></p></h2>
    <ol><li>Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic, then pick and finely chop the parsley (stalks and all).</li>
        <li>Sort through the clams, giving any that aren’t tightly closed a tap. If they don’t close, throw them away.</li>
        <li>When the pasta has 5 minutes to go, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, add the garlic and chilli flakes, and fry for 1 minute, or until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Throw in the clams, give the pan a good a shake, then after 30 seconds add the wine and pop the lid on.</li>
        <li>After 3 or 4 minutes, the clams will start to open – keep shaking the pan until they’ve all opened, then remove from the heat, and discard any clams that remain closed.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, drag the pasta straight into the pan of clams, then simmer for a minute or two in all the delicious juices.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed, then add the parsley and good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and toss together. Delicious served with a glass of chilled white wine.</li></ol>
